Invest in tradeable ceased products. Keep them for a while until the price improves significantly. Many players make huge numbers by "hoarding rares" (buying many ceased products at once and having them until the price rises). However, this technique is mainly based on fortune, as some rares can drop in price gradually (such as santa hats). Even with the Large Exchange being in position this can still be done, although traders would need to keep an eye on where the price is going. Also observe that most ceased products are very costly, different in price from nine thousand gold coins all the way up to over six hundred thousand gold coins.(prices of ceased modify by huge numbers over months). On the other hand players can buy vacation products such as pumpkin covers and santa caps a few several weeks before the joyful year, the expenses of these products almost always growth and progression of price arriving up to the joyful year.
